Before start the intro, run %windir%\System32\Speech\SpeechUX\sapi.cpl on your machine and select ENGLISH in Voice selection. If "David" voice is installed on your machine, definitely select it. If there is no male voices at all (what a shame!), start "hal_4000_female.exe" instead of "hal_4000.exe". Although, it's easy to install the required speech pack: go to Windows settings, choose Region & language, click on English (if it's not installed yet, add this language first), the Option button will appear. Click on it and find download option inside under Speech / Settings.

Visuals were coded on Apple iPad Pro, so the intro shouldn't take a lot of video chip resources. Must run smooth on any machine.

Tools used: GLSL Studio for iPad, Shader minifier, IQ's framework, Crinkler, 4klang, Renoise tracker, RS-Met's signal analizer, Microsoft SAPI, Visual Studio 2015. Thanks to everyone envolved in these tools development, this intro wouldn't be possible without you.
Personal thanks to Virgill for some 4klang assets and Provod/Yolp for assistance.
